\textbf{1.1} The following are the state diagrams of two DFAs, $M_1$ and $M_2$ . Answer
the following questions about each of these machines.

        \draw (q2) edge[bend left, below] node{\texttt{\ \ a,b}}(q3);
        \draw (q3) edge[bend left, above] node{\texttt{a}} (q2);
    \end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}
    

\begin{itemize}

\item What is the start state? \\
\textbf{R: } $q_0 = q_1 \in Q$

\item What is the set of accept states? \\
\textbf{R: } $F = \{q_2\}$

\item What sequence of states does the machine go through on input \texttt{aabb}
? \\
\textbf{R: }
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start state in $q_1$
    \item Read \texttt{a}, follow transition from $q_1$ to $q_2$
    \item Read \texttt{a}, follow transition from $q_2$ to $q_3$
    \item Read \texttt{b}, follow transition from $q_3$ to $q_1$
    \item Read \texttt{b}, follow transition from $q_1$ to $q_1$
\end{enumerate}

\item Does the machine accept the string \texttt{aabb}? \\
\textbf{R: } No, it doesn't. It rejects it because at the end of the input,
$M_1$ is in state $q_1$ which is not an accept state.

\item Does the machine accept the string $\varepsilon$? \\
\textbf{R: } If it does. Because when an empty string is accepted, the initial
state, which is also the accept state, remains the same.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}

\item What is the start state? \\
\textbf{R: } $q_0 = q_1 \in Q$

\item What is the set of accept states? \\
\textbf{R: } $F = \{q_1, q_4\}$

\item What sequence of states does the machine go through on input
\texttt{aabb}? \\
\textbf{R: }
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start state in $q_1$
    \item Read \texttt{a}, follow transition from $q_1$ to $q_1$
    \item Read \texttt{a}, follow transition from $q_1$ to $q_1$
    \item Read \texttt{b}, follow transition from $q_1$ to $q_2$
    \item Read \texttt{b}, follow transition from $q_2$ to $q_4$
\end{enumerate}

\item Does the machine accept the string \texttt{aabb}? \\
\textbf{R: } Yes, it does, because the state at the end of the string is $q_4$
which is an accept state.

\item Does the machine accept the string $\varepsilon$? \\
\textbf{R: } Yes, because the start state is also an accept state.
